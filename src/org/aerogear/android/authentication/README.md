Authentication API's
================
AeroGear Android has support for the AeroGear security and authentication system.

## Usage
The TODO(link?) application has a working demo of the Authentication system.  You can fine examples of how the APIs work and how they are called in the ToDoApplication class of that project.

## API Walk through
API.md has a walk through of the API with inline examples.  

## Interfaces and Implementation
This package contains the core interfaces of AG Security.  Anything written using them will work with any of our concrete classes.  This is excellent for testing, mocking, etc as our implementation classes are final.

## Builders
As with the rest of AG-Android, the authentication package makes use of the Builder pattern.
